- Create a program that implements a simple **mobile phone** with the following capabilities.
- Able to **store, modify, remove and query** contact names.
- You will want to create a separate clas for **Contacts (name and phone number)**.
- Create a **master class (MobilePhone)** that holds the ArrayList of Contacts.
- The MobilePhone class has the functionalities listed above.
- Add a menu of options that are available.
- **<u>Options</u>:  Quit, print list of contacts, add new contact, update existing contact, remove contact and search/find contact**.
- When adding or updating be sure to **check if the contact already exists (use name)**
- Be sure not to expose the inner workings othe Arraylist to MobilePhone
e.g. no ints, no .get(i) etc
- MobilePhone should do everything with Contact objects only.
