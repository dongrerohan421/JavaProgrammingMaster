# Car
We are going to go back to the car analogy.<br/>
Create a base class called **Car**<br/>
It should have a few fields that would be appropriate for a generice car calss. **engine, cylinders, wheels, etc**. <br>
Constructor should initialize **cylinders (number of) and name, and set wheels to 4 and engine to true**. <br/> 
Cylinders and names would be passed parameters.<br/>
Create appropriate **getters**.<br/>
Create some methods like **startEngine, accelerate, and brake**. show a message for each in the base class. <br/>
Now create 3 **sub classes** for your favorite vehicles. <br/>
Override the appropriate methods to demonstrate polymorphism in use.
